      "“Amaya historically constructed its own buildings. When we had to plan the execution strategy for our marquee, 70m tall residential building ONE49, we decided to evaluate contractors who were up to the challenge, would be able to construct the building as per our expectations within a tight timeline and without compromising safety or quality. After evaluating many candidates, we decided to award the contract to Hi Tech Projects Pvt. Ltd. Throughout the construction process, we found them to be professional and supportive. They deployed the required resources to ensure timely construction and paid close attention to safety and quality. They worked closely with our PMC team to work as ‘One Team’. We are pleased with the positive attitude and commitments shown by the promoters of the company throughout the construction process. We would be pleased to work with them in the future and happy to recommend them to anyone who is looking to construct quality buildings.”",
